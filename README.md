# Count_transitions

In this implementation, I recorded two ways of counting transitions in my MD trajectory.
One method uses a direct counting by looking at the adjacent transition to determine whether a legal transition happen within the commit time window. The other method, which converts the MD trajectory to a sequence of string, is simpler and can be easily converted to a multi-dimensional version.
